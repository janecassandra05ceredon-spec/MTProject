        <h2 style="font-family: agbalumo">Municipality of Solsona</h2>
        <p style="font-family:lush-tria;">Originated from the visita of Santiago. It lies on the Western slope of the Cordillera Mountain. It has a triangular shape. The town is bounded on the north by Piddig and Carasi; on the east by Nueva Era; on the south by Dingras and on the west by Dingras and Piddig. The town is 30 kilometers from Laoag City. Gasgas and Madongan Rivers flow on the southern side of the town. During rainy days, they easily overflow and cause floods. Solsona has many streams which supply adequate water forits agricultural needs.Santiago, originally called "Caitnegan," was a mission frontier for Itnegs in the 18th century. Augustinian priests converted the Itnegs to Christianity and established a mission center in Piddig. The Itnegs migrated to the area, causing a devastating flood in 1855 that destroyed the church and houses. The town was annexed to Dingras in 1904 but became independent in 1910.The name Solsona has various theories, including the Spaniards calling it "Solzona" due to its rhytmical sound, the Ilocano term for pushing people to further areas, and being copied from a town in Spain. The town faced financial difficulties during World War II, with Japanese soldiers and guerillas occupying the Gabaldon School building. Solsona is rich in agricultural products, including rice, corn, vegetables, cheese, gold, and lumber. The town has experienced disastrous floods, but has since improved its infrastructure, including the Solsona-Kalinga-Apayao Road and bridge. The town has also seen the establishment of various churches, including the Catholic Church, Protestants, and Iglesia ni Cristo.The economy of Solsona has evolved from primarily agricultural products to various types of businesses, with the first bishop of the Philippine Idependent Church, Father Gregorio Aglipay, becoming the first bishop.</p>

                    <p> There is no specific historical record or detailed information available about a Japanese garrison in Solsona, Ilocos Norte. However, it is likely that Japanese forces occupied or passed through the area during World War II, as they did throughout the Philippines. Historical records concerning Japanese garrisons in the Ilocos region, including the Ilocos Norte province, tend to be general and less detailed, lacking specific information on a garrison in Solsona itself </p>
