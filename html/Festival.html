                    <p style="font-family: bacasime-antique;"> A central feature is the "Abaludal Dance," which depicts the entire farming cycle, from planting and weeding to harvesting and preparation of the aba.Abalubal, a blend of the words aba (taro) and daludal (young taro shoot), are the town’s primary root crops. These exotic crops, which grow everywhere and are much-loved in Solsona, fittingly illustrate the townsfolk’s industry, simplicity and adaptability. As the sun rises, people embark on a new day of hard work and survival. They go to rivers, dig the crops using bamboo sharpened materials, and peddle them in the town market and around the community. The gabi leaves, stems and roots are sold in huge volumes at reasonable prices. They can be cooked fresh or dry and can still be delectable.</p>
                    <p>The Abaludal Dance also shows thanksgiving and praise to the patron saint, Saint James the Greater, for the bountiful harvest. </p>
